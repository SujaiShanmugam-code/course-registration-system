# Course Registration System

A simple web-based application for course registration, built with a front-end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks) and a back-end powered by **Java Spring Boot**. The backend is integrated with **MySQL**, **Hibernate**, **JPA**, and **Lombok** to handle data persistence and simplify development, Which is my first small full stack project with Springboot.

## Features

- **Course Enrollment**: Users can enroll in available courses.
- **View Available Courses**: Users can browse through a list of available courses.
- **View Course Information**: Users can view detailed information about each course.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL database for storing user and course information.
- **Automatic Entity Mapping**: Hibernate and JPA are used to map Java objects to database tables.

### Key Points:
- **Database Integration**: Configuration for MySQL is included in `application.properties`.
- **Dependencies**: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and Lombok are mentioned in the tech stack.
- **Lombok**: Reduces boilerplate code (such as getters/setters, constructors, etc.) to improve development speed and maintain readability.
